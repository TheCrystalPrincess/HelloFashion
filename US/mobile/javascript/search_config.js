My everyday make-up                      palette consists of more muted, earthy                      colours, so I didn’t go looking for this                      one – I discovered it while swatching                      for a ‘mermaidcore’ story. In the                      packaging it gives off shimmering                      seafoam and a frosty lavender hue.
