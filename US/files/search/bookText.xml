                    The camellia is a house code of Chanel, said to have been Coco Chanel’s favourite flower, and its
                   presence was prevalent this season, adorning every aspect, from the show set backdrop to the motifs
                     on ready-to-wear and accessories. Virginie Viard kept the collection comfortable, wearable and
                   lightly veering into eveningwear, whilst respecting the femininity of the brand as per her predecessors.

                       runway was filled with 60s-inspired glamour with a hardened edge, reflecting the confidence

                      look for the brand. It had less of its usual romanticism, veering away from embellishments
                       and fuss for a modern, cleaner edge. We saw an array of textures – velvet, shearling
                        and leather – as well as slip dresses with long, sharp silhouettes and strong coats.

                        anatomy: human; clothing and flowers. Volume and shape were at the core – accentuated waists,

                      paying homage to three
                       women that were a big
                      influence on the house:
                      Catherine Dior; Juliette

                       Based around the ‘love of clothes’, the collection was a reflection on the intimacy between
                        the garment and wearer. An explosion of glamour and gold, there were delicate hand-
                       painted floral prints, tailored pieces cinched at the waist and elegant outerwear with splashes
                        of gold foil. The raw edges on dresses sat well within the more masculine tailored styles.

                            Designed without a creative director at the helm, the collection paid tribute to the house’s history,
                             from Tom Ford’s sophisticated tailoring to Alessandro Michele’s eccentric styles in pops of colour.

                    Hconsidered more of
                    an accessory than a functional
                    timepiece. Now they are far
                    more practical and have evolved
                    aesthetically for women over
                    time, with the lines blurring
                    between traditional men’s

            One lucky reader can win a shopping
            spree at AllSaints stores. Enter for the
            chance to update your wardrobe now!



               or autumn, AllSaints is
               channelling the frenetic energy
               and rebellious spirit of the
           Ffirst British youth subcultures.
            The new campaign captures a
            group of characters united against
            conformity as they share a mutual
            desire to belong. Exploring the city’s
            hidden wilderness, they carry their
            individuality through the streets of
            Britain. The striking new collection
            expresses that free spirit. Silk slip
            dresses to dance all night in, sleek
            Lurex tailoring and super-soft leather
            biker jackets all set the tone.
              AllSaints has been a destination
            for quality clothing with an urban
            edge since 1994. Its collections
            are designed to make people
            look and feel good. Cult leather
            jackets, signature biker boots and
            unexpected prints are all designed
            in-house. AllSaints leather is iconic,
            each piece is crafted with its own

                            Burnished, gold-toned highlights are this season’s subtle take on balayage. Hand-painted through the mid-

                           lighter hues gleaming, apply a strengthening treatment, like L’Oréal Paris’ Elvive Bond Repair Leave-in Serum.

                     Topknots with a tail are very Y2K but we spotted them at Saint Laurent’s AW23 show – and on Florence
                    Pugh, sitting on the front row at Valentino. The fanned-out hair on top should be soft and pliable, not stiff or
                      spiky. Prep lengths with a fine, strong-hold hairspray and then brush it out once the topknot is in place.

              This season we saw

              at Akris and Antonio

          The secret to reviving
          hair that’s been braided

          a product with some

          like the L’Oréal Paris

          It delivers long-lasting

            Hair is identity, but hair-fall is something
            many of us will experience. Here, we look
            at why it happens and how to treat it



                   hedding hair is a natural process.
                   Old strands make way for new ones
                   as they go through their life cycle.
                   But when regrowth doesn’t appear,
            S hair-fall becomes a concern.
               On average, we shed 80-100 hairs a day, any
            more than this is considered hair-loss. With
            triggers including hair breakage, hormones,
            stress and certain medical conditions, it can
            be hard to pinpoint the cause and know where
            to start with treatment. The good news? The
            new L’Oréal Paris Elvive Full Resist [with
            Aminexil] range is specially formulated to
            reduce hair-fall and boost growth.

          How long have you lived in Ibiza?
          I’ve been coming to Ibiza for about 15 years
          and it will be ten years since I decided to
          make it my home.
          Why did you decide to spend most of the year here?
          We travel quite a lot, but always come back
          to Ibiza. I guess the beauty of the island, the
          energy it gives off and, above all, the people
          we meet here have been decisive. This island
          attracts a very special community of creative
          people. It’s really inspiring.
          When you first visited, what did you like most
          about the island?
          The deep sense of peace, a few days spent
          on this island are as relaxing as two weeks
          somewhere else.
          What are your favourite places to visit?
          I can’t really choose, there are so many… But
          I’d say it’s my group of friends and my home
          that matter, rather than a particular place.
          What does a perfect day in Ibiza look like for you?
          The beauty of Ibiza is that there are no schedules,
          you have to be open-minded and very flexible.
          I would say without a doubt that my perfect
          day is always the one we didn’t plan. But one of
          my favourite things is to work on my collection.
          Tell us about your house?
          It is an old country cottage that we restored.
          It is lost in the mountain of Sa Talaia and
          totally isolated. Only our friends can find it.
          It is our little hidden paradise. We were lucky
          to discover it, although it was nothing like what
          you see now. We had to refurbish the whole
          house. It had no windows and no electricity. But
          its renovation was and still is a beautiful journey.
          Creating our home is a never-ending process.
          How would you define the style of the property?
          In one word… simple. We made it for
          ourselves, and I think a good design is the
          one you don’t notice.
          What is your special corner in the house?
          It depends on the time of the day, the huge 

                 You created Inguna Collection using your
                 son’s drawings, how did he start painting?
                 He is very creative and we always make sure
                 there are paper, pens and paints around…
                 as well as his guitar. You can’t make your
                 children creative, but you can encourage
                 them. Also, the environment of the house
                 influences, we are surrounded by artistic
                 objects and books.
                 What has it been like to collaborate with your
                 own son on your designs?
                 It hasn’t been a conscious collaboration
                 because the Inguna Collection drawings
                 are the first ones he made when he was
                 little and that’s the beauty of the result.
                 He doesn’t draw in the same way now as
                 he did a few years ago. But who knows?
                 Maybe we’ll do more projects together
                 in the future.

                 I guess I have a romantic feeling about that
                 period of history. I ride quite a bit, but I
                 only ride on the dirt roads around the
                 house. It makes me feel wild and free. ■
